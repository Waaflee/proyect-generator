# Lib folder

Here you can add your header and .c files, i recommend using separate folders
for separate modules or libs.

For example if you are using my AVRDuino lib, it'll be cloned as /lib/AVRDuino/

The avr script found in the root of the project can be used to generate your
custom files for your specific needs, they'll be generated under /lib/custom/
